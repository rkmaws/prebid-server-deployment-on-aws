Auto-scaling cooldown periods were determined by analyzing ECS container logs.
Application startup times were extracted using regex pattern 'Started Application in (\d+\.\d+) seconds'
from log entries like: "Started Application in 57.529 seconds (process running for 59.231)".

Analysis of production logs showed:
- Average application startup time: 55.74 seconds
- P95 application startup time: 69.54 seconds

Based on these measurements:
- SCALE_IN_COOLDOWN_SECS is set to P95 startup time + 30s buffer (100s total)
  to ensure new containers are fully operational before scaling in again.
- SCALE_OUT_COOLDOWN_SECS is set to 60s to quickly respond to sudden traffic spikes.
